## 🌍 Global Transformation: AI & Work

📌 AI is a general-purpose technology reshaping:
- 🌾 Agriculture
- 🏭 Industry
- 🧑‍💼 Services

📈 *Over 50%* of organizations globally use AI. 

🧠 Comparable in impact to electricity or the internet.

> “AI is not about replacement, but about augmentation.” — OECD, 2023

## 📉 Job Disruption vs 📈 Job Creation

| Study | Year | Displaced Jobs | New Jobs Created |
|------|------|----------------|------------------|
| McKinsey | 2023 | 375M by 2030 | - |
| WEF | 2022 | 85M by 2025 | 97M by 2025 |

🔄 Middle-skill jobs transform rather than disappear.

🏗️ Example: Construction = From lifting bricks → managing drones and digital plans.

## 📉 Skills Losing Relevance

❌ Routine cognitive tasks (e.g., filing, arithmetic)
❌ Narrow tool-specific skills
❌ Static knowledge sets

✅ Emphasis shifts to *learning agility*, *conceptual thinking*, and *AI-awareness*.
