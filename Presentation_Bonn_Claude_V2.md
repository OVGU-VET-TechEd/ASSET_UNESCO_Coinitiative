Collaboration is at the heart of the UNEVOC Network, and the Magdeburg Centre continues to engage in new joint initiatives to drive innovation in TVET. One recent example is the ASSET project, which the Centre is involved in through UNESCO-UNEVOC's Network Coaction Initiative. ASSET stands for Accelerating and Strengthening Skills for Economic Transformation – a theme that aligns with the Centre's focus on future-oriented skills. This project brings together multiple UNEVOC Centres to address common challenges, such as digitalization and youth employment, by sharing expertise and developing joint solutions. As a Network Coaction project, ASSET is supported by UNESCO-UNEVOC with both technical guidance and funding to enable a 6-month collaborative pilot. The Magdeburg Centre, acting as a lead or partner in ASSET, coordinates with other countries' TVET institutions to create innovative training approaches that can be adapted globally. For instance, the project might develop a digital competency framework for TVET teachers or a set of AI-related training modules reflecting the growing importance of AI. Through ASSET and similar co-initiative projects, the Centre amplifies its impact beyond Germany, contributing to UNESCO's global effort to "shape the future of TVET" by building capacity across the UNEVOC Network. These collaborations also strengthen the Centre's own knowledge base, as partners exchange best practices and learn from each other's successes and challenges. In essence, projects like ASSET exemplify the Centre's commitment to international cooperation, ensuring that innovation in vocational training is a shared endeavor across borders.

--{{0}}--
Looking ahead, the Magdeburg UNEVOC Centre is strongly oriented towards the digital transformation of TVET, including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education and training. The rapid development of AI is reshaping both the workplace and learning environments, and the Centre is actively helping TVET systems adapt. In February 2025, for example, the Centre co-organized an Expert Meeting on AI and TVET at Fraunhofer IFF's "Factory of the Future" in Magdeburg. This international conference brought together leading experts to explore AI's transformative role in vocational education. Participants discussed cutting-edge developments – from AI tools that can assist teachers in lesson planning to AI-driven personalized learning platforms – and how these can be leveraged to improve training outcomes. A key takeaway was that integrating AI into TVET is essential to prepare learners for an AI-driven future of work. The Centre advocates a human-centered approach to AI in skills training, echoing UNESCO-UNEVOC's emphasis that while technology will augment training, the role of teachers and human oversight remains critical. Going forward, the Magdeburg Centre is likely to expand its initiatives on AI literacy for TVET instructors and students – helping develop curricula that teach not only how to use AI tools but also critical thinking and ethics in an AI-powered workplace. Through workshops, pilot projects, and research (often in collaboration with Fraunhofer IFF and OVGU's researchers), the Centre is shaping strategies for "AI in TVET" – such as identifying future competencies needed in an AI-automated economy, and creating simulation labs where trainees can practice with AI-enabled machines. By staying at the forefront of these trends, the UNEVOC Centre Magdeburg aims to ensure that vocational education in its network is future-ready, equitable, and responsive to technological change. The Centre's vision of "TVET 4.0" – where digital skills, AI proficiency, and sustainable development go hand in hand – will guide its projects in the coming years, in line with UNESCO's global TVET strategy for 2022–2029.

BIBB is a national centre of excellence for vocational training research and development, known for supporting Germany's dual training system and advising on future skills needs. Another recent member of the network is the Koblenz Chamber of Crafts, which joined in 2024. The Koblenz Chamber serves over 22,000 craft businesses and operates modern vocational training centers across its region; as a UNEVOC Centre it brings hands-on expertise in apprenticeship training and master craftsperson certification. All German UNEVOC Centres cooperate with each other and with the UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre in Bonn, which acts as the network's global hub. The UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre is headquartered at the UN Campus in Bonn (in the "Langer Eugen" high-rise, the former Parliament tower). From Bonn, UNESCO-UNEVOC coordinates the worldwide network of 230+ UNEVOC Centres, facilitates knowledge exchange, and supports projects like the Magdeburg Centre's through technical and financial assistance. The Bonn center also hosts international conferences and develops global resources (policies, toolkits, publications) to improve TVET systems. Together, the UNEVOC Centres in Germany and the UNEVOC HQ form a strong national and international alliance – linking German innovations and best practices in TVET (such as the dual system, green skills, and digital training methods) to UNESCO's worldwide efforts. By staying connected with other centres and the Bonn hub, the Magdeburg Centre ensures that its local initiatives contribute to global impact, helping learners and institutions far beyond its immediate region.
