# 2. AIâ€™s Impact on Labor Markets: Automation, Evolution and New Opportunities

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
  <img src="https://github.com/AEMSabbirRifat/UNESCO-asset/blob/0cd6270d254d6a2d285a87468b071e6f19882a64/AI%20%26%20the%20Future%20of%20Work/media/Ovgu%20logo%20orange.png?raw=true" alt="OVGU Logo" style="height: 60px; width: auto;">
</div>

## Automation and Job Market Alteration
- AI is rapidly transforming labor markets.
- AI automation handles repetitive, routine tasks (manufacturing, data entry, customer service).
- McKinsey (2030): Up to 375M workers may need to switch occupations due to AI.
- Historically, tech both destroys and creates jobs; AI is similar.
- WEF: 85M jobs displaced by 2025, but 97M new jobs could emerge.
- Quantity of work may hold steady, but its nature is profoundly altered.
- "Hollowing out" of job market:
    - Decline in middle-skill, routine jobs.
    - Growth in high-skill tech roles (AI developers, data scientists).
    - Growth in low-skill service roles (care workers, hospitality).
- Tendency toward polarization: more jobs at top/bottom, fewer in middle.
- Middle-skill work is changing, not disappearing (e.g., electricians, technicians with AI tools).

## Job Elimination, Diminished Roles & Conditions
- Some jobs will be eliminated or diminished (e.g., drivers, cashiers).
- AI threatens white-collar jobs: writing reports, drafting contracts, data analysis.
- AI advances in writing/analysis put office jobs at risk (e.g., marketing copy, code drafts).
- Nuanced view: AI displaces, but also changes job conditions.
- Algorithmic scheduling: AI decides shifts, potentially making jobs precarious/stressful.
- Intense monitoring (AI surveillance) raises safety and privacy issues.
- AI's labor impact: not just quantity, but *which* jobs, *whose* jobs, and *under what conditions*.
- Educators must anticipate shifts, prepare people to thrive sustainably with rights and wellbeing.

<div style="flex: 2.5; font-size: 90%;">

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">The Big Takeaway</span><br>

Future of work with AI is **transition and transformation**, not simple replacement.  

Jobs will evolve, require **higher-order skills**; new occupations will arise.  

Education must be forward-thinking:  
- What skills are needed when **routine work is automated**?  
- How to equip for careers spanning **multiple job changes** and **new job titles**?  

These questions lead to **essential competencies** in an AI-driven labor market.

## The Rise of Uniquely Human Skills
- As AI handles routine tasks, uniquely human skills become more valuable.
- Often called transversal, 21st-century, or soft skills.
- Timeless human competencies machines can't easily replicate.
- Include: critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, emotional intelligence, communication, teamwork, adaptability, ethical judgment.

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
  <img src="https://github.com/AEMSabbirRifat/UNESCO-asset/blob/0cd6270d254d6a2d285a87468b071e6f19882a64/AI%20%26%20the%20Future%20of%20Work/media/Ovgu%20logo%20orange.png?raw=true" alt="OVGU Logo" style="height: 60px; width: auto;">
</div>

## Key Essential Competencies: Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving

- AI excels at defined questions, but lacks general reasoning in novel situations.
- Humans needed to analyze complex, ambiguous problems, challenge assumptions, ask right questions (especially about AI outputs).
- Essential skill: knowing when to trust vs. question an algorithm's result.
- Employers seek critical data interpretation and non-rule-based decision-making.
- Judgment (experience, ethics, critical analysis) is irreplaceable by machines.

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
  <img src="https://github.com/AEMSabbirRifat/UNESCO-asset/blob/0cd6270d254d6a2d285a87468b071e6f19882a64/AI%20%26%20the%20Future%20of%20Work/media/Ovgu%20logo%20orange.png?raw=true" alt="OVGU Logo" style="height: 60px; width: auto;">
</div>

## Key Essential Competencies: Creativity and Innovation
- AI can simulate creativity, but genuine innovation stems from human insight.
- Human workers focus on creative tasks, design, big-picture ideas.
- Example: AI generates ad variants, but human creatives drive brand strategy, emotional storytelling.
- New fields (AI ethics, green tech) require imaginative thinking.
- Educational systems must nurture creativity (project-based learning, arts, interdisciplinary thinking) as a core competency.

</div>



## Flexible & Responsive Institutions
- Educational institutions must become more flexible and responsive.
- Support learning at any age, any career stage, not just early life.
- Create flexible learning pathways:
    - Part-time programs, online courses, micro-credentials.
    - Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).
    - Bridges between formal and non-formal learning.
- Example: Mid-career worker takes a 3-month online course for a new role.
- Micro-credentials (e.g., data analytics, AI ethics) are gaining popularity.
- UNESCO's TVET strategy emphasizes flexible credentials for continuous upskilling.

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">

</div>

## Evolving Teacher's Role & Methods
- Teachers are no longer just content transmitters (AI can assist here).
- Teachers become:
    - Facilitators of skills development.
    - Coaches in "learning how to learn."
    - Mentors in personal growth.
- Teachers themselves need continuous professional development for AI tools and new pedagogies.
- UNESCO AI Competency Framework for Teachers (2024): defines teacher knowledge on AI.

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
  <img src="https://github.com/AEMSabbirRifat/UNESCO-asset/blob/0cd6270d254d6a2d285a87468b071e6f19882a64/AI%20%26%20the%20Future%20of%20Work/media/Ovgu%20logo%20orange.png?raw=true" alt="OVGU Logo" style="height: 60px; width: auto;">
</div>

## Learning-Integrated Work & Systemic Support
- Workplaces are becoming sites of continuous learning ("learning-integrated work").
- Companies constantly retrain staff for new AI systems.
- Forward-thinking organizations: internal academies, partnerships with educators.
- Industry's role: Public-private partnerships for up-to-date curricula and apprenticeships.
- Governments: Update policies to support lifelong learning (funding, incentives, flexible certification).
- Experimenting with personal learning accounts (funds for retraining).
- Systemic supports are crucial; individuals cannot constantly retrain at their own expense.

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
  <img src="https://github.com/AEMSabbirRifat/UNESCO-asset/blob/0cd6270d254d6a2d285a87468b071e6f19882a64/AI%20%26%20the%20Future%20of%20Work/media/Ovgu%20logo%20orange.png?raw=true" alt="OVGU Logo" style="height: 60px; width: auto;">
</div>

## Recognition of Informal Learning
- People learn from YouTube, online communities, MOOCs.
- Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) offers formal credit for skills acquired outside formal school.
- Especially relevant in AI era for self-taught tech skills (e.g., coding via online platforms).
- Pathways needed to certify skills without traditional degrees.

</div>


## Equity Dimension of Learning Pathways
- Without deliberate action, AI could widen educational inequalities ("digital divide").
- Inclusion must be front and center in evolving education.
- Lifelong learning opportunities must be accessible to all: rural, marginalized, disabled.
- Means: community training centers, free online resources, assistive technologies.
- Universal quality basic education is the foundation.
- UNESCO-UNEVOC: Stresses "flexible pathways to lifelong learning opportunities for all."
- Goal: AI helps "elevate TVET for a just and sustainable future for all."

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">

</div>

## Cultivating a Lifelong Learning Culture
- Not just a policy slogan; it's a culture to cultivate.
- Learners must see education as a lifelong pursuit.
- Educators must embrace new roles and adapt (e.g., taking AI courses, redesigning curricula).
- Need champions in schools/colleges to push for changes.
- Simple updates (lesson plans with AI case studies) to complex overhauls (work-based learning modules).

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 73px; right: 130px; z-index: 1000;">
